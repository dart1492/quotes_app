# quotes_app

A small quotes app (how innovative!), made with Flutter and some additional packages. Just a practice project, with potentially cool featurews to be added later.

## Main features
- #### Post quotes
just write your name (or whatever word you want other people to associate you with) and quote, click Done -  and its done! 
- #### Read quotes from other people. 
All those 'quote cards' are stored in Firebase Firestore, the load time is almost 0 - everything goes as smooth as it is. 

## Used Packages
This small project makes use of some additional libraries:
- GetX for state managment;
- Firebase - related libraries (to store the data);
- Packages that provide usefull functionality - beautifully animated transitions, dialogs. All are stated in a pubspec.yaml file;
