# quotes_app

A small quotes app (how innovative!), made with Flutter and some additional packages. Just a practice project, with potentially cool featurews to be added later.
## This is still a row thing, and I plan to add some usefull functionality (like rating and sorting the quotes, tags, etc...) later

## Main features
- #### Post quotes
Just write your name (or whatever word you want other people to associate you with) and quote, click Done -  and its done! 
- #### Read quotes from other people. 
All those 'quote cards' are stored in Firebase Firestore, the load time is almost 0 - everything goes as smooth as it is. 
- #### Animated dialogs and buttons.
Just to spice up the design.

## Used packages
This small project makes use of some additional libraries:
- GetX for state managment;
- Firebase - related libraries (to store the data);
- Packages that provide usefull functionality - beautifully animated transitions, dialogs. All are stated in a pubspec.yaml file; 
## Showcase
Here is a little showcase, where I create a new account and post random qoute in a global quotes pool:
